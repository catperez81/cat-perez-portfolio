    <h1 class=section-header>Introduction</h1>
      <p class=section-content> I lead product and design for <a href="https://www.healthsherpa.com/" target="_blank">HealthSherpa</a>, a Healthcare Startup in San Francisco. I placed first in the <a href="http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/wire/2013/12/04/controversial-salesforce-hackathon.html?page=all2013" target="_blank">  Salesforce $1M hackathon </a> a couple of years ago with some friends.  Our entry was a simple and intuitive version of Healthcare.gov. After the win, I knew I had to pursue a career dedicated to improving the flawed and dated system that is healthcare. Outside of work, I enjoy good coffee, pizza anytime of day, and road trips with my wife and pup. </p>
    
      <p class=section-content> Education, communication, collaboration, and honesty are all things I find important in life and work. I've learned to value these since I've spent most of the past 2 years of my career on very small teams. It truly makes all the difference.</p>

  <h1 class=section-header>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p class=section-content> I am from the East Coast - New Jersey to be exact (born and raised). My mother is from South Korea and my father is from Puerto Rico. I grew up around a lot of my father's family (most in NJ), so I picked up some Spanish along the way. I attended college in Long Island, NY - and soon after I graduated moved to San Francisco where I lived for the past 8 years. I've recently relocated to Los Angeles, where I currently live and work remotely. </p>
